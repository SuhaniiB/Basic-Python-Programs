The practice questions solved in the file name="Lab_Exercise_2.ipynb" are as follows:

Case Study 1: Employee Salary Calculation
Scenario: A company wants to calculate the net salary of its employees after applying taxes 
and bonuses. The salary is determined based on the following operations:
• The base salary is increased by a fixed bonus.
• A tax percentage is then deducted from the total.
• The net salary should be calculated while respecting the precedence of operations.
Exercise:
1. Write a Python program that takes the base salary, bonus, and tax percentage as input.
2. Calculate the gross salary by adding the bonus to the base salary.
3. Calculate the net salary by subtracting the tax (as a percentage of the gross salary) 
from the gross salary.
4. Ensure the order of operations is respected.

Case Study 2: Shopping Cart Total Calculation
Scenario: A local grocery store has asked you to create a simple program that calculates the 
total amount a customer needs to pay after applying discounts and taxes. The store offers a 
discount on the total purchase, and after applying the discount, a tax is added to the discounted 
amount.
Exercise:
1. Write a Python program that takes the total purchase amount, discount percentage, 
and tax percentage as input.
2. Calculate the discounted amount by applying the discount percentage to the total 
purchase amount.
3. Calculate the final amount to be paid by adding the tax (as a percentage of the 
discounted amount) to the discounted amount.
4. Ensure that the operations are performed in the correct order, respecting operator 
precedence
